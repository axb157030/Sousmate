Sousmate is an interactive user friendly website that works with the MealDB API to send users recipes in a step by step manner upon request. You can find the MealDB API here, https://www.themealdb.com/api.php. It has a timer the user can set to measure the time needed to complete specfic steps of a recipe. 

# Description
---
This project was initally assigned to me by Revature through its RevaturePro online program you can find here, https://revature.com/learn-to-code/. As I worked more on the project I decided to add my own unique touches to it. Ultimately, the ending project was very different from the one that they initially assigned. I first designed the webpages based on the wireframes they provided me but I later sketched my own wireframes through paper. I made menubar.css to give the overall styling of the webpages for Sousmate.
